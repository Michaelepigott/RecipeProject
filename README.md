# Description
    - We created this to explore the inner working of back-end development and how it could solve the problem of storing recipes on a server.
    - This app gives a solution to the piles of cookbooks we have laying around. The fact that we only use 1 or 2 recipes from each creates a huge storage problem. Grandma's recipe cards are pretty old, yellowed and covered in stains. Let's put them all in one place.
    - We can also search and be inspired by other users. With the ability to search for recipes by one word in a Recipe title.
    - This project has created a bases for understanding Model, View, and Controller and how they work together. There are a lot of moving parts to consider.
